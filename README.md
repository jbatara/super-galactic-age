# _Super Galactic Age_

#### _A Planetary Age and Estimated Lifespan Calculator, September 7th, 2019_

#### _By **Jennifer Batara**_

## Description

This application asks for a user's information and determines what their age would be on many different planets in our solar system. Also, if the person is from the USA, they will be prompted to fill out a lifestyle survey to determine their estimated lifespan.

All Earth age to other plantary/animal years were converted using ratios provided by the original problem prompt by _Epicodus_.

The estimated lifespans by country and gender were obtained from the [World Health Organization](http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main). Lifestyle dependent lifepsans for those living in the United States were loosely based on the following article:

[Li, Yanping, et al. "Impact of healthy lifestyle factors on life expectancies in the US population." _Circulation_ 138.4 (2018): 345-355.](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.032047)
